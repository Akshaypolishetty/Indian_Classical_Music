# Indian_Classical_Music

This project aims to develop an automated system for recognizing and analyzing Indian Classical Music (ICM), covering both Hindustani and Carnatic traditions. Using advanced signal processing and machine learning, the system will classify raagas, detect taalas, and identify instruments from audio data. The output will enhance ICM accessibility for learners and researchers, while preserving and exploring this music through modern technology.
